/**
 * A manager for proof node objects. This is a trusted interface for creating
 * and updating ProofNode objects.
 *
 * In more detail, we say a ProofNode is "well-formed (with respect to checker
 * X)" if its d_proven field is non-null, and corresponds to the formula that
 * the ProofNode proves according to X. The ProofNodeManager class constructs
 * and update nodes that are well-formed with respect to its underlying checker.
 *
 * If no checker is provided, then the ProofNodeManager assigns the d_proven
 * field of ProofNode based on the provided "expected" argument in mkNode below,
 * which must be provided in this case.
 *
 * The ProofNodeManager is used as a trusted way of updating ProofNode objects
 * via updateNode below. In particular, this method leaves the d_proven field
 * unchanged and updates (if possible) the remaining content of a given proof
 * node.
 *
 * Notice that ProofNode objects are mutable, and hence this class does not
 * cache the results of mkNode. A version of this class that caches
 * immutable version of ProofNode objects could be built as an extension
 * or layer on top of this class.
