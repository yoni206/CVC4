 ** \brief The BVToInt preprocessing pass
 **
 ** Converts bit-vector formulas to integer formulas.
 ** The conversion is implemented using a translation function Tr,
 ** roughly described as follows:
 **
 ** Tr(x) = fresh_x for every bit-vector variable x, where fresh_x is a fresh
 **         integer variable.
 ** Tr(c) = the integer value of c, for any bit-vector constant c.
 ** Tr((bvadd s t)) = Tr(s) + Tr(t) mod 2^k, where k is the bit width of 
 **         s and t.
 ** Similar transformations are done for bvmul, bvsub, bvudiv, bvurem, bvneg,
 **         bvnot, bvconcat, bvextract
 **
 ** Tr((bvand s t)) depends on the granularity, which is provided by the user
 ** when enabling this preprocessing pass.
 ** We divide s and t to blocks.
 ** The size of each block is the granularity, and so the number of
 ** blocks is:
 ** bit width/granularity (rounded down).
 ** We create an ITE that represents an arbitrary block,
 ** and then create a sum by mutiplying each block by the
 ** appropriate power of two.
 ** More formally:
 ** Let g denote the granularity.
 ** Let k denote the bit width of s and t.
 ** Let b denote floor(k/g) if k >= g, or just k otherwise.
 ** Tr((bvand s t)) =
 ** Sigma_{i=0}^{b-1}(bvand s[(i+1)*g, i*g] t[(i+1)*g, i*g])*2^(i*g)
 **
 ** More details and examples for this case are described next to
 ** the function createBitwiseNode.
 ** Similar transformations are done for bvor, bvxor, bvxnor, bvnand, bvnor.
 **
 ** Tr((bvshl a b)) = ite(Tr(b) >= k, 0, Tr(a)*ITE), where k is the bit width of
 **         a and b, and ITE represents exponentiation up to k, that is:
 ** ITE = ite(Tr(b)=0, 1, ite(Tr(b)=1), 2, ite(Tr(b)=2, 4, ...))
 ** Similar transformations are done for bvlshr.
 **
 ** Tr(a=b) = Tr(a)=Tr(b)
 ** Tr((bvult a b)) = Tr(a) < Tr(b)
 ** Similar transformations are done for bvule, bvugt, and bvuge.
 **
 ** Bit-vector operators that are not listed above are either eliminated using
 ** the function eliminationPass, or are not supported.

   * A generic function that creates a node that represents a bitwise
   * operation.
   *
   * For example: Suppose bvsize is 4, granularity is 1, and f(x,y) = x && y.
   * Denote by ITE(a,b) the term: ite(a==0, 0, ite(b==1, 1, 0)).
   * The result of this function would be:
   * ITE(x[0], y[0])*2^0 + ... + ITE(x[3], y[3])*2^3
   *
   * For another example: Suppose bvsize is 4, granularity is 2,
   * and f(x,y) = x && y.
   * Denote by ITE(a,b) the term that corresponds to the following table:
   * a | b |  ITE(a,b)
   * ----------------
   * 0 | 0 | 0
   * 0 | 1 | 0
   * 0 | 2 | 0
   * 0 | 3 | 0
   * 1 | 0 | 0
   * 1 | 1 | 1
   * 1 | 2 | 0
   * 1 | 3 | 1
   * 2 | 0 | 0
   * 2 | 1 | 0
   * 2 | 2 | 2
   * 2 | 3 | 2
   * 3 | 0 | 0
   * 3 | 1 | 1
   * 3 | 2 | 2
   * 3 | 3 | 3
   *
   * For example, 2 in binary is 10 and 1 in binary is 01, and so doing
   * "bitwise f" on them gives 00.
   * The result of this function would be:
   * ITE(x[1:0], y[1:0])*2^0 + ITE(x[3:2], y[3:2])*2^2
