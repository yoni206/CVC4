/** LazyTrie
 *
 * This is a trie where terms are added in a lazy fashion. This data structure
 * is useful, for instance, when we are only interested in when two terms
 * map to the same node in the trie but we need not care about computing
 * exactly where they are.
 *
 * In other words, when a term n is added to this trie, we do not insist
 * that n is placed at the maximal depth of the trie. Instead, we place n at a
 * minimal depth node that has no children. In this case we say n is partially
 * evaluated in this trie.
 *
 * This class relies on an abstract evaluator interface above, which evaluates
 * nodes for indices.
 *
 * For example, say we have terms a, b, c and an evaluator ev where:
 *   ev->evaluate( a, 0,1,2 ) = 0, 5, 6
 *   ev->evaluate( b, 0,1,2 ) = 1, 3, 0
 *   ev->evaluate( c, 0,1,2 ) = 1, 3, 2
 * After adding a to the trie, we get:
 *   root: a
 * After adding b to the resulting trie, we get:
 *   root: null
 *     d_children[0]: a
 *     d_children[1]: b
 * After adding c to the resulting trie, we get:
 *   root: null
 *     d_children[0]: a
 *     d_children[1]: null
 *       d_children[3]: null
 *         d_children[0] : b
 *         d_children[2] : c
 * Notice that we need not call ev->evalute( a, 1 ) and ev->evalute( a, 2 ).

/** SygusSampler
 *
 * This class can be used to test whether two expressions are equivalent
 * by random sampling. We use this class for the following options:
 *
 * sygus-rr-synth: synthesize candidate rewrite rules by finding two terms
 * t1 and t2 do not rewrite to the same term, but are identical when considering
 * a set of sample points, and
 *
 * sygus-rr-verify: detect unsound rewrite rules by finding two terms t1 and
 * t2 that rewrite to the same term, but not identical when considering a set
 * of sample points.
 *
 * To use this class:
 * (1) Call initialize( tds, f, nsamples) where f is sygus datatype term.
 * (2) For terms n1....nm enumerated that correspond to builtin analog of sygus
 * term f, we call registerTerm( n1 )....registerTerm( nm ). It may be the case
 * that registerTerm( ni ) returns nj for some j < i. In this case, we have that
 * ni and nj are equivalent under the sample points in this class.
 *
 * For example, say the grammar for f is:
 *   A = 0 | 1 | x | y | A+A | ite( B, A, A )
 *   B = A <= A
 * If we call intialize( tds, f, 5 ), this class will generate 5 random sample
 * points for (x,y), say (0,0), (1,1), (0,1), (1,0), (2,2). The return values
 * of successive calls to registerTerm are listed below.
 *   registerTerm( 0 ) -> 0
 *   registerTerm( x ) -> x
 *   registerTerm( x+y ) -> x+y
 *   registerTerm( y+x ) -> x+y
 *   registerTerm( x+ite(x <= 1+1, 0, y ) ) -> x
 * Notice that the number of sample points can be configured for the above
 * options using sygus-samples=N.
