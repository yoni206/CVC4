 * The (distributed) equality engine manager. This encapsulates an architecture
 * in which all theories maintain their own copy of an equality engine.
 *
 * This class is not responsible for actually initializing equality engines in
 * theories (since this class does not have access to the internals of Theory).
 * Instead, it is only responsible for the construction of the equality
 * engine objects themselves. TheoryEngine is responsible for querying this
 * class during finishInit() to determine the equality engines to pass to each
 * theories based on getEeTheoryInfo.
 *
 * This class is also responsible for setting up the master equality engine,
 * which is used as a special communication channel to quantifiers engine (e.g.
 * for ensuring quantifiers E-matching is aware of terms from all theories).
