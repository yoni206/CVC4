   * contains a map from introduced skolem variables to the index in
   * assertions containing the new definition created in conjunction
   * with that skolem variable.
   *
   * As an example of (1):
   *   f( (ite C 0 1)) = 2
   * becomes
   *   f( k ) = 2 ^ ite( C, k=0, k=1 )
   *
   * As an example of (2):
   *   g( (and C1 C2) ) = 3
   * becomes
   *   g( k ) = 3 ^ ( k <=> (and C1 C2) )
   *
   * As an example of (3):
   *   (lambda x. t[x]) = f
   * becomes
   *   (forall x. k(x) = t[x]) ^ k = f
   * where k is a fresh skolem function.
   * This is sometimes called "lambda lifting"
   *
   * As an example of (4):
   *   (witness x. P( x ) ) = t
   * becomes
   *   P( k ) ^ k = t
   * where k is a fresh skolem constant.
